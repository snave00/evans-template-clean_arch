## Getting Started

🤖 Upon **cloning**, 
- Get the **configs** folder file and paste it into ```assets/``` for the ```.env``` file
- Create ```.env.dart``` in ```lib/utils/env```
- Run ```flutter clean``` & ```flutter pub get```
- **Run** ```dart run build_runner build``` to generate all `*.g.dart` files used in `json_serializable`, `freezed`, `envied`.


🤖 Before **pushing**, make sure to **check codes** if it follows code convention & always `fix imports`.
