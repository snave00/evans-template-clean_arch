# evans_template

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

ðŸ¤– Upon **cloning**, make sure to **run** ```flutter pub run build_runner build``` to generate all `*.g.dart` files used in `json_serializable`.

ðŸ¤– Before **pushing**, make sure to **check codes** if it follows code convention & always `fix imports`.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
